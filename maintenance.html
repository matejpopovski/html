Here's why:</p>			<h3 class="content">Backup breakdowns</h3>			<p>Backups can provide recovery options in case of accidental deletion, drive failure and other disasters.  But often, backup software silently stops working, leaving users with the feeling they're protected when in fact they're moving ever further away from safety. Periodic reviews help to ensure that backups are working properly.			</p>			<h3 class="content">Drive and directory damage</h3>			<p>Drives and directories are the foundations upon which all project files and folders are built. Crashes and software errors can cause directory damage which leads to unstable operation and data loss. And after spinning for months at 7200 rotations per minute, drive failure is just a matter of time. Early detection and correction of drive and directory issues prevents problems from snowballing.			</p>			<h3 class="content">Internet insecurity</h3>			<p>As Macs become more popular, they're attracting more attention from computer criminals. In recent years, a steady stream of security updates have been released for products from Apple, Adobe and Microsoft. Regular updates, antivirus software, and proper configuration can reduce exposure.			</p>			<p><a href="contact.html">Contact Square Circle Consulting</a>  to keep your Macs - and your projects - running smoothly.			</p> 		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><br /></p>		</div>		</td>		</tr>		</table></div><div id="testimonial">	<p class="testimonial_text" style="margin-bottom: 0">		<br /><br /><br />	</p></div><div id="footer"><p style="margin-bottom: 0">Copyright &copy; Square Circle Consulting, LLC, PO Box 14287, Madison, WI 53708.
